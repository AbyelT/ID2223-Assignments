# Project: Swedish Electricity Price Prediction

## Intro
The purpose with this project is to apply the knowledge and expereinces gained from the course activities e.g. lectures and labs to build a Scalable Prediction Service, using real-time and historical data of electricity prices. Electricity prices have fluctuated greatly since autumn 2022, it is hard to forecast the future price for most consumers. The price determined by the supply and demand, which in turn is affected by many factors e.g. geoplotical (ongoing conflicts), environmental (colder climates) or regulations. The purpose with the prediction service is to let consumers plan ahead on when to increase or decrease electricity consumption to minimize costs. 

<!-- The project has the following tasks:

1. Build and run a feature pipeline on Modal
2. Build and run a training pipeline on Modal
3. Build and run an inference pipeline with a Gradio UI on Huggingface Spaces -->

## Data Sources

The data that will be used for this project is related to electricity generation and consumption, weather forecasting and current electricity prices in different regions of Sweden. The following data sources have been preliminary selected for the project, the data sources may change later.

- Entsoe: historical data on energy generation and consumption.
- SMHI API: historical and real-time data on weather.
- Elpriser API: real-time data on electricity prices, is updated daily.
- Energimarknadsinspektionen: historical data on monthly electrical prices.

## Tools
- Python: Programming Language.
- Libraries: Pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib e.g for data exploration and feature engineering.
- Hopsworks: Storing feature groups and models (alt. Hugging Face).
- Modal: Perform feature engineering, run or deploy ML models on the cloud.
- Tensorflow: Platform for preparing data and building ML models.
- Hugging Face: UI for model inference.
