# Lab 1: Serverless ML with Iris Flower Dataset

## Intro
The purpose with this lab is to learn how to setup a serverless ML system with existing tools e.g Modal, Hopsworks and Huggingface Spaces. This lab uses the Iris Flower Dataset and the Titanic dataset, The lab has the following tasks:

1. Build and run a feature pipeline on Modal
2. Build and run a training pipeline on Modal
3. Build and run an inference pipeline with a Gradio UI on Huggingface Spaces

## Tools
- Feature Store: Hopsworks
- Feature & training pipeline: Modal
- Inference pipeline: Hugging Face Spaces 

## Architecture

## Task 1
